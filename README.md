# YouTube Shorts Generator Workshop
A Workshop designed to introduce people to Amazon BedRock and Step Functions. We will cover off the basics of Amazon Bedrock and then walk through how we can use AWS SAM to deploy our application into AWS. 

By the end of this workshop, the users should have a fully working Serverless application that is capable of generating YouTube Shorts videos based on a prompt input provided by the user.

## Prerequisites
